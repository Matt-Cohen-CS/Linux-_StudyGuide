# Purpose
The point of this script is to easily get answers to the Comptia Linux+ study guide exam questions. This is not the "official" exam but just the
practice exam. This will allow quicker feedback, greater accuracy and easier studying by allowing users to simply put the answers in a text file and simply run the script. Development took roughly 4 - 6 hours and the script has easily saved me 15-30 minutes per chapter attempt.
